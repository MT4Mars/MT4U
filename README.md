MT4U Reaper Scripts

Cockos Reaper Scripts, developed to enhance the use of CSI (Control Surface Integrator)

The different folders contain the necessary scripts for each functionality.

MT4U_View (Show/Hide tracks with button feedback)
-------------------------------------------------
    These scripts are for setting a tracks "category" and then use surface buttons to
    show/hide tracks depending on their category.

    You can configure your buttons however you want. The provided configuration works out of the box
    with the View buttons on an MCU:
        MIDI Tracks - Audio Tracks - Audio Inst. - Aux - Busses - User
   
    The buttons will show/hide tracks depending on their category.

    Pressing the "Alt" modifier will provide feedback on the category associated with the selected
    track. Pressing one of the buttons will change the category.
